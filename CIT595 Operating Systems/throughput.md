refers to the number of processes, threads, tasks, jobs that the OS can execute in a given period of time. 
A higher throughput means the OS was very efficient in managing resources to avoid bottlenecks and also cpu [[scheduling]].
A high system load can decrease throughput when too many processes are competing for resources
