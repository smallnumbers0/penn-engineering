useful work done in user space

number of processes, threads, tasks, jobs that the OS can execute in a given period of time. 

A higher throughput means the OS was very efficient in managing resources to avoid bottlenecks and also cpu [[scheduling]].

A high system load can decrease throughput when too many processes are competing for resources

spending more time in the kernel from context switching due to a smaller time slice means more throughput because of less useful work done in user space
