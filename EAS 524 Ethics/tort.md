accidental harm/incidents

was it intentional?

People should have a duty, acting reasonably in similar circumstances. To be predictiable 
Ex: driving predictably so other drivers know what you are up to.

BPL approach - whether the burden that you take to avoid accidents that results from your conduct is proportional to the potential  loss that your conduct exposes to others
Ex: turning on headlights in the rain for safety for yourself and others.
