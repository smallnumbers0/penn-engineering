purposes:
1. Facilitating interactions between private individuals
2. Maintaining order through state power
3. Solving problems that need the [[state]]’s involvement

Three main areas of law for individual disputes:

- Contract Law: Deals with agreements between people. Covers what makes a contract binding, if it needs to be written, limits (like selling organs), what counts as a breach, and what remedies exist.

- Property Law: Defines ownership (land, stuff, intellectual property). Covers buying, selling, using, losing, or having property stolen, and how courts resolve these issues.

- Tort Law: About personal wrongs (from the Latin “tortum”—twisted/wrong). Mostly deals with accidents/injuries (battery, negligence, product defects). Defines what counts as a wrong, how to resolve it, and court remedies.

Criminal Law: State can prosecute
Robbing a store is an example of breaking property and tort law, but also a criminal law

Laws also go against problems that society cannot solve alone such as market failures, monopolies, public goods, externalities like pollution, 

Law helps resolve individual conflicts, keeps society peaceful, and steps in to fix big problems (market failures) that need collective action.

Limits of the laws:
- difficult and expensive to enforce
- effectiveness depends on design no matter how good the intention of the law us
Three main types of costs affect laws:

1. **Enforcement Costs**

- These are the expenses of making sure a law is followed, like hiring lawyers, gathering evidence, and spending time in court.
- Because enforcement is expensive, most legal rules aren’t enforced most of the time—especially for small cases where the cost outweighs the possible reward.

3. **Agency Costs**

- Show up mostly in contracts, when two parties have different incentives.
- Example: An employer wants an employee to work all agreed hours, but constantly monitoring them is expensive and distracting.
- Employees might slack off sometimes because perfect monitoring isn’t possible, and bosses accept this since micromanaging costs more than the lost productivity.

5. **Transaction Costs**

- The broadest category: includes gathering information, negotiating contracts, and enforcing rights.
- Example: If your house is damaged by pollution, you’d need to figure out who caused it, prove it, talk to other affected people, and hire lawyers. All this takes time and money.
- High transaction costs can stop people from enforcing their rights or even from making deals that would benefit everyone.

If a law is costly for some people but not others, it can create unfairness and undermine the goal of maintaining peace.

Limit of the laws: Public Choice

- Laws and regulations are often created to fix market failures, but government solutions can fail too.
- Harold Demsetz called it the “nirvana fallacy” to assume regulation will always fix market problems without considering the flaws in government solutions.
- Public choice economics studies how government decisions can go wrong.

Key ideas from public choice economics:

**Tyranny of the Minority (Logic of Collective Action):**

- We hear a lot about the “tyranny of the majority,” but minority groups (small, organized interest groups) can actually have more power because they’re easier to organize and keep on message.
- Large groups (like the general public) are hard to coordinate, so they often don’t act, while small groups can pool resources to lobby for laws that benefit them.
- This can lead to policies that serve narrow interests rather than the majority.

**Politicians’ Incentives:**

- Politicians don’t magically become selfless when elected—they have their own interests and biases.
- Their #1 priority is to stay in office, so they focus on getting re-elected, which often means serving the interests of powerful or organized groups.
- **Rent Extraction and Interest Groups:**

- Interest groups (especially monopolies) invest resources to get laws that benefit them.
- In exchange, they might support politicians’ campaigns or public image.
- Monopolists can use their extra profits to keep out competition by influencing government rules.

**Regulatory Capture:**

- Regulators are often industry insiders because they have the expertise needed to regulate.
- This “revolving door” means regulators sometimes go back and forth between industry and government, which can create conflicts of interest.
- Even if they aren’t corrupt, their close ties to industry can lead to regulations favoring the industry over the public.


**Bottom line:** Regulation isn’t a perfect fix. Small, organized groups can have outsized influence, politicians have their own incentives, and regulators can end up serving the industry they’re supposed to oversee. These are just some of the challenges in using law and regulation to solve big problems.


The Limits of Law: Strategic Behavior

- People and companies affected by laws will try to use them to their advantage, often in ways lawmakers didn’t expect.
- The law’s purpose is to change behavior, but those being regulated usually want to keep doing things their way.

Key concepts and examples from telecom regulation:

**Gold Plating**

- AT&T’s prices were regulated by “rate of return”—they could charge customers enough to cover expenses plus a set profit on capital investments.
- This encouraged over-investment (gold plating): AT&T had an incentive to spend more on its network, since it guaranteed them more profit.
- Result: High-quality networks but very expensive service, especially for long distance calls.

**Cream Skimming / Regulatory Arbitrage**

- In the 1960s, MCI entered the market offering only long distance service, undercutting AT&T’s prices because they didn’t have to subsidize local service.
- This “cream skimming” targeted the most profitable customers.
- When regulation creates these margins, exploiting them is called regulatory arbitrage—taking advantage of rules for profit.
- Modern example: Uber and Airbnb avoided many traditional regulations, letting them offer cheaper services than taxis or hotels.

**Incentive Misalignment**

- In the 1980s, regulators switched to “price caps”—setting a maximum price that would decrease over time, to mimic competition.
- Instead of innovating to lower costs, companies just cut service quality and investment to maintain profits.
- Rate of return rules made companies over-invest; price caps made them under-invest. In both cases, companies acted strategically to maximize profits, not necessarily to provide the best service.

Main lessons:

- When designing laws, expect people to look for loopholes or ways to game the system.
- It’s tough to create legal rules that work as intended, since those being regulated will always try to interpret and use them strategically.

Case Study Utility Poles

- The issue: A new internet company wants to use existing utility poles in a small town to run fiber optic cables. The question is—what’s a fair price for access?
- Utility poles cost about $3,000 each, with one every 200 feet (about $75,000 per mile). That’s twice the cost of installing fiber cable itself.
- Since the poles are already there and partway through their lifespan, the new company shouldn’t have to pay the full cost, just a fraction.
- Complications:

- The telephone company owns the poles and has already factored their cost into what customers pay for internet.
- If the new company pays for access, the telephone company can either pocket the money or use it to compete harder.
- If the new company doesn’t pay, the telephone company ends up subsidizing a competitor.

- It gets trickier:

- The electricity company also uses the poles—how should costs be split among all users?
- Poles often carry wires for several services (electric, cable, phone, wireless). How do you divide costs fairly?

- There’s big money at stake:

- The new company might spend up to 50% more on network buildout if it has to pay for pole access.
- Both companies will lobby local regulators hard—each wants rules in their favor.

- Local regulators:

- Want competition (good for the public).
- Have long-standing relationships with the telephone company.
- Worried the new company will only serve wealthier areas (cream skimming), making it harder for the telephone company to keep prices low for poorer customers.

- More questions:

- Should utility poles be public goods?
- Why are they owned by the telephone company at all?
- Should they be owned/maintained by a third party or the state?
- What happens when the infrastructure ages—who should own and replace it?

- This is a real issue debated by the FCC and local governments since the 1960s, especially when new cable companies wanted access to existing poles.
- Bottom line: What seems like a simple question—how much should you pay to use a utility pole—is actually tangled up with economics, regulation, lobbying, fairness, and public policy.

Structure of the American State

U.S. government has three branches (from the Constitution):

- Article I: Congress (legislative)
- Article II: President (executive)
- Article III: Judiciary (courts)

- Each state has its own constitution and government.

States vs. Federal Law:

- Federal law overrides state law when there’s a conflict (Supremacy Clause).
- Otherwise, states can set their own laws (9th & 10th Amendments).
- Examples of state law differences:

- Wiretap/recording laws: some states require all-party consent, others only single-party.
- “False light” tort: about 30 states recognize it, 20 don’t.
- Data privacy: few states have strict laws (e.g. CA, NY), most don’t.
- Biometric data: some states require consent, most don’t.

- Product design & tech can be affected by these differences (e.g., user authentication, data collection, liability).

Federal vs. State Laws:

- Many states have their own antitrust & consumer protection laws.
- Federal law allows non-conflicting state laws to exist and be enforced.
- Sometimes state laws can conflict with each other.

Federal Judiciary Structure:

- Federal courts have three levels:

1. District Courts (trial courts) – where most cases start, handle facts & law.

- Every state has at least one; bigger states have more districts.

3. Circuit Courts of Appeals – 13 total, hear appeals from district courts.

- 11 are geographic, plus DC Circuit (mostly agency appeals) and Federal Circuit (patents, armed forces, etc.).

5. Supreme Court – hears 60-70 cases/year, mainly to resolve conflicts between circuits (“circuit splits”).

- Has discretionary jurisdiction (chooses which cases to hear).

State Courts:

- Each state has its own court system, handling most criminal and civil cases.
- Federal courts handle cases involving federal law or large disputes across states.
- Most everyday legal issues (e.g., injury, contracts, property) are handled by state courts.

Regulatory Agencies:

- Mentioned as an important “mystery piece” to be covered separately.
## The Regulatory State

- Congress passes laws (statutes) that are collected in the United States Code (U.S.C.), which is about 25,000 pages long and has 53 titles.
- Regulatory agencies (like the FCC, FTC, EPA, DOT, NHTSA) make rules that also have the force of law. These are published in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which is over 200,000 pages.
- Most U.S. law is regulatory law, not statutory law.
- Agencies are created by Congress through statutes, and their power comes from (and is limited by) those statutes.
- Agency leaders are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Their important decisions can be challenged in federal courts.
- Agencies sit in a weird spot between Congress (Article I), the President (Article II), and the courts (Article III).
- Two types of agencies:

- Executive agencies: Led by people who report directly to the President and can be fired at will.
- Independent agencies: Run by a group (like commissioners), can only be fired for cause, and operate more independently from the President.

- Agencies are constitutional because:

- President appoints leaders (executive branch involved)
- Congress creates them and sets their powers (legislative branch involved)
- Courts can review their decisions (judicial branch involved)

- Examples:

- FCC: Created by statute, led by 5 commissioners appointed by the President/Senate.
- EPA: Also created by statute, led by an administrator appointed by President/Senate.

- Agencies do what Congress tells them—sometimes the instructions are very specific, sometimes broad.

- Example of specific: EPA must set air quality standards for nitrogen dioxide over 3 hours unless not needed for public health.
- Example of broad: FCC must make rules to improve telecom/internet access for schools, healthcare, libraries, as much as is technically and economically possible.
- Sometimes, agencies use broader mandates to make big rules (like net neutrality), even if the original statute doesn’t mention those exact words.

- When agencies make rules, those rules are enforceable as law. Agencies can enforce them internally or in federal courts.
- Bottom line: To understand what an agency is doing, always start with the statute that created and empowered it.
## Competition between states

- States don’t just focus inward (on citizens/laws), but also have to deal with competition and conflict with other states.
- There’s no global government to enforce international law—treaties only work if countries want to follow them.
- International bodies like the UN/WTO depend on member cooperation, not real enforcement power.
- In the U.S., treaties signed by the President (with Senate approval) can have the force of law and sometimes be enforced in U.S. courts, but most treaties worldwide aren’t enforceable like this.
- International law is mostly based on countries’ ongoing self-interest and is called “customary international law.”
- After WWII, countries saw the value in honoring treaties to avoid chaos/war, but that can change if interests shift.
- Major world powers (U.S., EU, China) have very different views on tech, privacy, and the state’s relationship to citizens, which leads to tension.
- Example: U.S. and EU have clashed over privacy laws (Safe Harbor, Privacy Shield, GDPR). European courts have blocked U.S. companies from handling EU citizen data in ways that violate EU privacy rules.
- U.S. and China have even bigger differences—China demands more control over companies, sometimes requiring things that would be illegal in the U.S.
- Technology makes these conflicts bigger because tech is global—companies operate across borders, but laws are national.
- Europe values citizen rights most, China values state security most, U.S. is more market-based and flexible about rights.
- Hard to make these three approaches work together, especially as global cooperation seems to be declining.
- International legal issues are getting more important, especially in tech, and will keep coming up in the future

## Who Regulates AI?

What is AI? What does it mean to regulate? And who’s actually in charge?

- Defining AI is hard for regulators; it covers lots of technologies (LLMs, recommendation systems, machine learning for healthcare, autonomous vehicles, etc.).
- Regulations often lump all these techs together under “AI,” which can lead to unintended consequences (e.g., rules meant for LLMs accidentally apply to basic recommendation engines).
- Sometimes, laws even try to regulate “algorithms” without really understanding that an algorithm can be just basic math.
- Regulators mostly don’t have a clear, unified definition of AI—they’re trying to regulate a moving target.
- Regulating AI can mean a bunch of things: controlling outputs (copyright, defamation), design requirements, data traceability, who can build or release models, open vs. closed source, and use cases (where/how AI can be used).
- Laws might require things that are technically impossible, but could still be passed.
- Regulation can also target users, uses, integration (e.g., which AI assistants are allowed in Windows), opt-in/opt-out for data, and import/export restrictions.
- Who regulates? Tons of players:

- Federal agencies (FTC for marketing, DOT/NHTSA for cars, FAA for drones, HHS for healthcare)
- Non-regulatory bodies like NIST (sets standards, not laws)
- Congress and state legislatures—each can pass laws, sometimes conflicting
- Existing laws (copyright, wiretap) can apply to AI
- The market itself (funding, development choices)
- Developers and designers (decide system capabilities)
- Users (how AI is actually used)

- Modern tech is “generative”—it can be used in ways no one expected, which makes regulation even harder.
- International dimension: U.S., EU, and China all approach AI regulation differently, balancing innovation, security, and rights. Their choices affect global competition.
- The U.S. tries to balance innovation (not falling behind China) and protecting citizens (like the EU), but it’s a tricky trade-off.
- In reality, “who regulates AI?” pretty much everybody”—lots of overlapping, sometimes conflicting efforts from all directions.
