Shifts in tort law driven by the **Industrial Revolutions**: complex products and long supply chains made the “ordinary reasonable person” standard impractical. The law adapted so consumers wouldn’t have to dismantle a car to find which component failed.

consumers arent expected to understand how to product works. products should work as expected

The centerpiece is **Section 402A of the Second Restatement of Torts**, which imposes liability on sellers for products in a defective, “unreasonably dangerous” condition causing physical harm, without requiring proof of negligence. “Unreasonably dangerous” is judged by what an ordinary consumer would expect, given common knowledge about the product’s characteristics.

This creates **strict products liability**: an injured consumer can sue any seller in the chain—manufacturer, brand, or retailer—and let the supply chain sort indemnity out later. The doctrine organizes defects into three buckets: design defects, manufacturing defects, and warning (failure-to-warn) defects.

Finally, products liability is relatively **young—about 50–100 years old**—and varies by state and court. It has historically sidestepped much of software, but that boundary is shifting, especially for tech products.

Tort law as form of insurance

**products liability** as a form of **no‑fault (strict) liability**, where injured consumers don’t have to prove the manufacturer was negligent—they only need to show the product caused the harm. That shift changes the economics: instead of spending heavily to argue about fault, producers can price expected injuries into the product and pay claims predictably.

A key intuition challenge is the **BPL (burden‑probability‑loss) framework** from negligence. Under negligence, you’re only required to take cost‑effective precautions. Strict liability doesn’t actually make it rational to overspend on safety; firms still invest up to the point where added safety is worth it, then add a small premium to the price to fund expected payouts. In effect, strict liability turns the product price into an **insurance pool**: everyone pays a little; the injured are compensated quickly without protracted litigation.

This structure **reduces administrative and legal costs**, increases **predictability** for both consumers and manufacturers, and speeds recovery. But the video also flags that the “strictness” of products liability has **evolved**—modern doctrine sometimes incorporates negligence‑like features—so the balance between safety incentives, pricing, and litigation is still a moving target.

Insurance Challenges: Moral Hazard and Adverse Selection

strict products liability, priced into goods as a risk premium, effectively turns manufacturers into insurers. That predictability is attractive, but it introduces two classic insurance problems: **moral hazard** and **adverse selection**.

Moral hazard means insured users may take extra risks or even commit fraud—think staged appliance fires—because they don’t fully internalize losses. Adverse selection means adding the premium can push low-risk buyers out, leaving a higher-risk pool and spiraling prices; the **1980s insurance crisis** for items like **skiing** and **child products** is the cautionary tale.

Economically, the same BPL logic still governs safety investment: firms won’t overspend beyond cost‑effective precautions; they’ll price the expected loss and pay claims. The policy design challenge is incentive alignment—rules should deter opportunism without collapsing markets.

This pressure has driven products liability to adopt **negligence‑like safety valves** over time, tempering pure no‑fault with doctrines that screen behavior and stabilize the system.

Manufacturing Defects

consumers should not need to inspect products for manufacturing defects

Manufacturing defects are the cleanest slice of products liability: if a product **deviates from its design**, the seller is liable for injuries—even if they exercised all possible care. The consumer doesn’t need to prove negligence or proper use; the only question is whether the item left the factory different from what the design specified.

The intuition is practical. Modern products are complex and not meant for consumer disassembly or expert inspection; expecting users to catch a mis-sized screw or a wrong **resistor** is unrealistic and dangerous. So liability attaches when the build strays from the blueprint.

Two boundaries matter. First, strict liability here focuses on physical harm to persons or property; **pure economic loss** isn’t covered. Second, software raises hard questions: is a bug a “manufacturing defect” or something else? The video flags this as a live issue for later discussion.

Design Defects

Design defects are the most contested slice of products liability. Early doctrine used the **ordinary consumer expectation** test—defective if the product is more dangerous than an ordinary buyer would anticipate. Modern courts often favor **Reasonable Alternative Design (RAD)**: a product is defectively designed if foreseeable risks could be reduced or avoided by a reasonable alternative, and the plaintiff shows both injury and that alternative.

Even under these negligence‑like standards, it remains strict liability in a crucial sense: a user’s **misuse or carelessness isn’t a defense** if a design defect exists. Designers must anticipate “ordinary use,” which includes foreseeable, imperfect behaviors, and engineer around them.

Feasibility matters. Safety that turns a car into a **tank** isn’t “reasonable” if it makes the product unusable or wildly expensive. That tradeoff gets thorny in software, where alternatives—library choices, cloud vs. local storage, algorithm selection—are invisible to users yet can change reliability and safety, especially in **cyber‑physical systems**. The video flags software design defects as a major, evolving frontier.

Warning Defects

Warning defects are the muddiest corner of products liability. The core idea is simple—if **foreseeable risks** could be reduced by **reasonable warnings**, the seller must provide them, and omission can render a product not reasonably safe. The hard part is judging what counts as “reasonable” without overwhelming users or distracting them at critical moments.

Two anchors help. First, the famous **hot coffee** example shows context matters: the same product can be more dangerous in one setting (drive‑thru) than another (inside), making tailored warnings sensible. Second, **warning fatigue** is real—listing every hazard (pharmaceuticals are the classic case) can cause users to tune out, which courts recognize.

The Third Restatement’s most practical guidance: when a **safer design** can reasonably reduce risk, adopt the design rather than lean on warnings that leave a significant residual danger. In short, design out hazards where feasible; use warnings for irreducible risks, and make them targeted, meaningful, and proportionate.
