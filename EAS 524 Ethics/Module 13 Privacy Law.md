20-30 years ago most humans did not give thought to what happens to information that they share to others. Everything we do today leaves a persistent digital trail. There are a lot of laws that each regulate different aspects of information that we can and cannot share about each other.

### Perspectives on Privacy Law


Professor James Q Whitman's Article: The Two Western Cultures of Privacy

The Right of Privacy by Warren and Brandies: "We have a right to a private life". The question is should someone be able to take a photo of you in your own backyard. Today technology is intertwined in our lives and people that we talk to. Whatever we do in public is part of the public and we have no control over it. What we do in private is separate from the public sphere and we should be able to have control over it. 

Is a private conversation in a public park private? 
Is a fight inside your home that's loud enough for the public private?
Are websites that we visit or access or request to private?

These questions cannot be answered by dividing the world by its private and public spheres. AS a society we need to decide how we want to treat this information that is between the private and public matter.

Whitman explains privacy as a function of dignity. You have a right to chose how you are going to present your private self to the world. The goal is to shield individuals from humiliation and unwanted public scrutiny to give you some control about who the public thinks you are. 

Historically this was a tool for protecting aristocracy, so that lower classes in society cant expose personal affairs to the public. Kings, Nobles, can protect themselves from people of the lower class

During the American view of privacy, Whitman describes that privacy is liberty. The goal was to protect individuals from the government. This can be found in the 1st 4th and 5th amendments: The government cannot censor speech, take your stuff, force you to testify against yourself. 

Privacy means different things to different people around the world especially in our technological state. In most cultures, what use to be very private is now partially public and companies from a country is very likely to interact with companies from another country. For example: The US and European companies have very different privacy rules and attitudes towards the people within their countries. 

### Section 230 of Communications Decency

Platforms cannot be held liable for how their users use those platforms. Most important law for understanding how platforms view content created by their users

Historically, publishers and distributers of harmful content, can often be held liable for it. A newspaper and the author of article of the newspaper can both be held liable for harmful content. This was the case for early internet platforms and risked liability for problematic content. Even if they tried to moderate content, they could also face liability for harmful content that they missed.

Today platforms like Facebook or Reddit do not have to moderate the speech as heavily as needed due to Section 230. Shield and Sword: 
Shield: Platforms cannot be held liable for what their users post. 
Sword: Platforms are free to engage in moderation of content created by their users, but they do not need to be perfect in the moderation.

First Amendment: do not have the business of regulating speech in these platforms. They trust that these platforms have trustworthy speech. 

Section 230 was critical to the growth and success of the internet from 1990 to 2000s

Before 2015: Section 230 meant platforms cannot be held liable for user's speech

Today this immunity is being challenged by the courts. The questions are whether the platform directs or solicits certain types of content(creating hate towards certain groups of people), or where the platform has actual knowledge of physical harm that has resulted from how its users are using the platform. However, Section 230 (2024) will generally be unchanged in the foreseeable future


### Privacy Law in the States

Privacy Tort: Intrusion upon seclusion: Invasion of privacy
- defendant conduct must be intentional
- defendant invaded without lawful justification into private affairs or concerns
- a reasonable person would regard the invasion as highly offensive ,causing distress, humiliation
Ex: a highly offensive case is starring at your private area for 30 minutes, but just a look is not offensive

Privacy Tort: Appropriation of a person's name/likeness
- using someone name for personal gain or commercial advantage Ex: Using a famous actor's voice to make money without their permission
- For a random person, that person needs to show evidence of economic harm, but not embarrassment
Privacy Tort: Public Disclosure of Private Facts
The defendant gives publicity to a matter concerning the private life of another
- Plaintiff did not consent to the publication
- The matter publicized or the act of publication would be highly offensive to a reasonable person
- the publication was not of legitimate concern to the public
EX: sharing private videos of a person
Ex: True highly offensive information

Privacy Tort: Publicity placing a person in false light
Defendant publicized info that placed the plaintiff in a false light that is highly offensi8ve to a reasonable person.
- false light involves untrue information unlike the other 3 torts
- only if the false light is highly offensive
- Many states do not recognize false light as tort out of concern that it violates the First amendment

Defamation
- Negligently making false statement about a person to a third party that causes them harm
- Ex: such as economic losses (losing a job) or emotional harms
- punishment is against the harm from the speech and not the speech itself



Privacy: Contract Law
Tort Law: Ways a person can harm another but there is no injury is there is consent
The scope of the consent is governed by the contract law. The agreements of private policies are contracts



### Federal Privacy Law

Sector specific federal privacy laws
EX: HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), Gramm-Leach-Bliley (financial privacy) regulates banks with personal information
FERPA(student records)
Privacy Act(privacy of info held by the government)
Communications Act(privacy of info held by telephone companies)

Some general purpose Privacy Laws
Wiretap Act: prevents intercepting communications using a device, recording conversation without consent, using a camera to watch someone type an email

Video Privacy protection Act: prohibits video rental stores from sharing information such as rental history

In the US many privacy laws are written to respond to specific incidents
Challenge of this: When Netflix came out, could Netflix share your watch history with anyone?
Congress had to update this law and say that companies like Netflix and Youtube can share what users have watched online

Federal Trade Commission has consumer protection authority. They can take action to prevent unfair and deceptive practices. They make sure companies do not take advantage of or lie to consumers
- companies need to have a privacy policy
- need to share the privacy policy to users
- need to follow the privacy policy
Companies can put in the privacy policy that they can give your data away to others as well (disclaimer) This is consent based, unless it deals with children in which a separate law specifies that children who are 13 years or younger need a parent's consent.

Congress can adopt newer federal privacy laws 

### Case Study: Gmail and Wiretapping

Federal wiretap Act 18 U.S Code & 2510 : Illegal to intercept a communication using a device. Statutory violations. $500 per violation

In 2008 Google began scanning all incoming emails to build advertising profiles for its users. Gmail users have consented to this agreement, but non-Gmail users did not consent. In 2010, users began suing google for wiretap. Judge rejected googles dismissal of the case. This is a good example of contract being governed by the government. Google reached a settlement and stopped scamming incoming emails

In 2016. google would wait until the emails would enter the user's inbox. Google is no longer intercepting communication in transit and is reading a communication received out of storage are governed by two different laws and is no longer under the wiretap act. 

google wiretaping case:
Operation of both federal and state wiretap acts needs communications to be in transit
Clear disclosures of privacy policies to not be vague and reach a good mutual understanding of what agreement is


### Case Study: The US Privacy Vanguard

EU General Data Protection Regulation as a global privacy standard has heavily influences US laws (especially CCPA California consumer privacy act and CPRA Californiia Privacy Right Act)
GDPR makes sure data must be used for specific purposes that are legitimate and  legal with consent from user. Users have right to access this data and have the right for the data to be forgotten
GDPR controversy is endless pop-ups about cookies to collect information
GDPR lowered venture capital investment in EU by about 15%

These California laws make sure that cookies always pops up, but does not need consent. THey both requre organization to only collect and use data for specificp urposes, request copies of information about them which must be shared in electronic form. Users can also require companies to delete or correct information about them, and to explain how information about them is being used. They also both allow users to prohibit a company from selling or sharing their information


### Case Study: The EU Privacy Vanguard

EU Artificial intelligence Act 2024: Divides ai apps into 4 categories
- unacceptable risk application(which are banned)
- high risk (heavy regulation)
- limited risk (transparency obligations)
- minimal risk (unregulated)
also ahs rules for general purpose AI models and systems using those models

Unacceptable risk applications include: real time biometric scanning, emotion inference, social scoring, predicting criminal conduct

high risk apps: systems used in critical infrastructure, education, workplace, relation to government services

limited risk: chatbots or ai generated images where users might expect to know they are interacting with AI systems

minimal risk: AI used in video games and spam filters

Many aspects of AI act touches privacy related issues. 
EX: AI using cameras to spy on you and map your entire day
social scoring systems- dignity and autonomy 
systems that process personal information

general purpose models must maintain a summary of sources of content used to train the model and why its relevent for the model
