**Main Goals of Data Analytics**

- **Pattern Detection/Structure Discovery**

- Find patterns and relationships in data.
- Examples: Categorizing sales by region/product, clustering documents by concept.
- Uses descriptive statistics to visualize and summarize data.

**Hypothesis and Experiment Driven Analysis**

- Make and test predictions about data (e.g., does a factor increase risk?).
- Uses inferential statistics and significance testing.
- If a feature is strongly predictive, build machine learning classifiers for outcomes.

**The Data Analytics Pipeline**
**Data Acquisition & Access**

- Getting permission and figuring out what data is available can be challenging.
**Data Wrangling**

- Unifying data from different formats and sources.
**Multimodal Data Integration**

- Linking data from various types (images, text, tables).
**Data Cleaning & Filtering**

- Removing artifacts and bias, keeping only relevant data.

**Hypothesis Formation & Evaluation**

- Pose questions, analyze, and test hypotheses.

**Model Building**

- Use machine learning algorithms to make predictions or classifications.

**Exploration & Understanding**

- Explore and interpret data, present results clearly and ethically.

**Ethics and Best Practices**

- Protect private data, follow good statistical practices, avoid misleading presentations.

**Real-World Example**

- Kaggle.com hosts data science challenges like classifying bird calls from audio.
- Steps include data cleaning, feature extraction, building classifiers.

**Reality vs. Myth in Data Science**

- Myth: Just dump data in the cloud, run algorithms, and get answers.
